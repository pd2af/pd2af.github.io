# Development

This page outlines the features of the current version of the converter.  

## Current version: PD2AF 1.0

The implemented logic takes into account on the work by Vogt and coauthors (Vogt et al., 2013, [doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-7-115](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-115)) and further develops the logic to minimise the number of complexes in AF version and to introduce pattern recognition functionalities.

What is new in the Milestone 1 PD2AF version 1.0:
1. The code is written in Lisp programming language and is accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/pd2af/converter).
1. Added pattern recognition for removing "intermediate" complexes.
1. Added pattern recognition for so-called "hidden" inhibition when events are shown in details without using the _inhibition_ arc.
