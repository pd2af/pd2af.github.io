<p>PD2AF converter is an open-source application designed to enable communication between the Process Description and the Activity Flow languages of the <a href="http://sbgn.org">Systems Biology Graphical Notation</a> (SBGN) standard. The purpose of the tool is to translate PD to AF in such a way so it produces the result comparable to manually designed AF diagrams and the corresponding logical models.</p>

<h3>Activation of protein phosphorylation: active unphosphorylated state</h3>

Associated GO term: <a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001934">GO:0001934 positive regulation of protein phosphorylation</a>

<p>This is a case of a "hidden" inhibition: from the Process Description version it is not obvious that this is an inhibition because the mechanism is shown in details and the inhibition arc is not used. Protein A stimulates a process of protein B deactivation (the state of the left is shown as active), and therefore in Activity Flow it is represented by the protein A activity inhibiting the protein B activity.</p>
