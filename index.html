<p>PD2AF converter is an open-source application designed to enable communication between the Process Description and the Activity Flow languages of the SBGN standard. The purpose of the tool is to translate PD to AF in such a way so it is possible to avoid using complexes in the resulting AF version and therefore be as close as possible to manually designed AF diagrams and the corresponding logical models.</p>
